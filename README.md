The city of New York does restaurant inspections and assigns a grade. Inspections data for various years are available on s3 as an SQLite database, which you can import in the next few cells. These were extracted from a set of CSV files and an XLS file.

The raw data can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataincubator-course/coursedata/nyc_inspection_data.zip) and can be useful to look at. The file `RI_Webextract_BigApps_Latest.xls` contains a description of each of the data files and what the columns mean.
